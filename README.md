## Rubric Points

- *Student describes their model in detail. This includes the state, actuators and update equations.*

Student describes their model in detail. This includes the state, actuator and update equations.
The kinematic model considers the vehicle's position (in x and y coordinates), the orientation angle *psi*, velocity *v*, the cross-track error *cte*, and the orientation error *epsi*.
The outputs are acceleration *a* and steering angle *delta*, which are also called actuator outputs. The model combines the state and actuator parameters from the previous timestep to calculate the values of the current timestep. The following equations are used to achieve that:

- *Student discusses the reasoning behind the chosen N (timestep length) and dt (elapsed duration between timesteps) values. Additionally the student details the previous values tried.*

The values for N and dt were chosen as 10 and 0.1 based on the recommendation from the Udacity lessons. I experimented with different values, but achieved the best results with the values above. I tried to increase or decrease the total time (*N x dt*) to look further ahead into the future or even less than a second. Looking further ahead did not lead to a significant information gain, but needed longer to calculate. Less than a second seemed not to be enough information. A value between 0.75s and 1.5s seemed to work. The resolution of *N = 10 steps* also seemed to be a good compromise to have a detailed enough polynomial while not consuming too much calculating power.

- *A polynomial is fitted to waypoints. If the student preprocesses waypoints, the vehicle state, and/or actuators prior to the MPC procedure it is described.*

The waypoints are transformed into the vehicle space (perspective from the vehicle) to simplify the process to fit the polynomial to the waypoints. The vehicles position is now located at the origin (x and y value is 0) and the orientation angle was set to be 0 as well.

- *The student implements Model Predictive Control that handles a 100 millisecond latency. Student provides details on how they deal with latency.*

I first removed the 100ms latency and started tuning the cost function of the model. For that I increased the cte penalty to get a responsive behavior, but had to be careful to not overshoot and oscillate (I was getting motion sick just by looking at it). I kept the penalty for the actuator parameters low as I wanted the model to be more reactive to the other values. Increasing the values for epsi and delta helped to smoothen out the controls and get a responsive behavior with minimum overshooting and oscillation. After adding a 100ms waiting time to simulate the latency in the system the model had significant problems in the tight turns and started again to oscillate, especially after exiting the curves. I added therefore a delay time in the calculations to compensate for the latency. The code can be found in main.cpp, line 139 to 145.

## Basic Build Instructions

1. Clone this repo.
2. Make a build directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
3. Compile: `cmake .. && make`
4. Run it: `./mpc`.

## Tips

1. It's recommended to test the MPC on basic examples to see if your implementation behaves as desired. One possible example
is the vehicle starting offset of a straight line (reference). If the MPC implementation is correct, after some number of timesteps
(not too many) it should find and track the reference line.
2. The `lake_track_waypoints.csv` file has the waypoints of the lake track. You could use this to fit polynomials and points and see of how well your model tracks curve. NOTE: This file might be not completely in sync with the simulator so your solution should NOT depend on it.
3. For visualization this C++ [matplotlib wrapper](https://github.com/lava/matplotlib-cpp) could be helpful.)
4.  Tips for setting up your environment are available [here](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/40f38239-66b6-46ec-ae68-03afd8a601c8/modules/0949fca6-b379-42af-a919-ee50aa304e6a/lessons/f758c44c-5e40-4e01-93b5-1a82aa4e044f/concepts/23d376c7-0195-4276-bdf0-e02f1f3c665d)
5. **VM Latency:** Some students have reported differences in behavior using VM's ostensibly a result of latency.  Please let us know if issues arise as a result of a VM environment.

## Editor Settings

We've purposefully kept editor configuration files out of this repo in order to
keep it as simple and environment agnostic as possible. However, we recommend
using the following settings:

* indent using spaces
* set tab width to 2 spaces (keeps the matrices in source code aligned)

## Code Style

Please (do your best to) stick to [Google's C++ style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html).

## Project Instructions and Rubric

Note: regardless of the changes you make, your project must be buildable using
cmake and make!

More information is only accessible by people who are already enrolled in Term 2
of CarND. If you are enrolled, see [the project page](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/40f38239-66b6-46ec-ae68-03afd8a601c8/modules/f1820894-8322-4bb3-81aa-b26b3c6dcbaf/lessons/b1ff3be0-c904-438e-aad3-2b5379f0e0c3/concepts/1a2255a0-e23c-44cf-8d41-39b8a3c8264a)
for instructions and the project rubric.

## Hints!

* You don't have to follow this directory structure, but if you do, your work
  will span all of the .cpp files here. Keep an eye out for TODOs.

## Call for IDE Profiles Pull Requests

Help your fellow students!

We decided to create Makefiles with cmake to keep this project as platform
agnostic as possible. Similarly, we omitted IDE profiles in order to we ensure
that students don't feel pressured to use one IDE or another.

However! I'd love to help people get up and running with their IDEs of choice.
If you've created a profile for an IDE that you think other students would
appreciate, we'd love to have you add the requisite profile files and
instructions to ide_profiles/. For example if you wanted to add a VS Code
profile, you'd add:

* /ide_profiles/vscode/.vscode
* /ide_profiles/vscode/README.md

The README should explain what the profile does, how to take advantage of it,
and how to install it.

Frankly, I've never been involved in a project with multiple IDE profiles
before. I believe the best way to handle this would be to keep them out of the
repo root to avoid clutter. My expectation is that most profiles will include
instructions to copy files to a new location to get picked up by the IDE, but
that's just a guess.

One last note here: regardless of the IDE used, every submitted project must
still be compilable with cmake and make./
